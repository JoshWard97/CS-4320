# Module 2 (Week 2): Models and Methods
**TODO: Divide this material up into two lessons... Decide what to skip and what to emphasize**

## Discuss GitHub assignment...
How did it go? What were the problems? How can they do better? Do we need another shot?  
## Review important stuff
*You did not hit this last Thursday and it is important...*  

**Definition of SWE:**  
The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to all aspects of software production from problem definition through maintenance.  
**Goals of SWE (make good software):**  
 > This feeds from the "software crisis presented in week 1 ... so, it naturally feeds into these goals.
 
- Dependability (Reliability)  
- Maintainability
- Efficiency
- Acceptability (or functionality or correctness; meets requirements)
- Security

## Incorporate Readings?
What are the main themes you want to convey for these readings? Do we want to trim anything?
- A View of 20th and 21st Century Software Engineering
- Waterfall
- Agile Manifesto and Principles
- Fowler on Agile
- Comparative Analysis of Software Engineering Models  from Traditional to Modern Methodologies

## SWEBOK content
This chapter on software engineering models and
methods is divided into four main topic areas:  
• **Modeling:** discusses the general practice
of modeling and presents topics in modeling
principles (what is a model, abstraction, what are they good for); properties and expression of
models (completeness, consistency, correctness); modeling syntax, semantics, and
pragmatics; and preconditions, postconditions,
and invariants.  
• **Types of Models:** briefly discusses models
and aggregation of submodels and provides
some general characteristics of model types
commonly found in the software engineering
practice. (information modeling, behavioral modeling, structure modeling)  Mentions UML briefly.
• **Analysis of Models:** presents some of the
common analysis techniques used in modeling
to verify completeness, consistency, correctness,
traceability, and interaction.  
• **Software Engineering Methods:** presents a
brief summary of commonly used software
engineering methods. The discussion guides
the reader through a summary of heuristic
methods (Structured Analysis and Design, Data Modeling, Object Oriented Analysis and Design), formal methods, prototyping, and
agile methods (covers RAD, XP, Scrum, FDD).  

## UML? or do it under design?
