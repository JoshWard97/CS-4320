1. Has one of the methods: Waterfall, RAD, XP, Scrum, or FDD for project management, with reasons presented that are accurate for that methodology. [I can't think of reasons Waterfall would be reasonable though...] I suppose they may choose to combine some aspects of different Agile methods - as long as they explain what they are doing and why.
2. Includes at least one of SAD or OOA&D to modularize the problem and solution.
3. Includes Data Modeling to understand the data.
4. Explains a plan of action for how they will implement the methods. Looking for how they could do this as a team, not just individually.
