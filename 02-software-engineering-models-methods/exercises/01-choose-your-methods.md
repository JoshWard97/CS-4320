# Exercise 2.1: Choose Your Methods
## Group Exercise for Course Groups Set 2
**Groups are assigned in Canvas**

Your group (Course Group Set 2) will be working together for several weeks.  
We anticipate having exercises related to stages of the software development life cycle (requirements, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. NOTE: These are exercises, not the semester project.)

Discuss as a group which method(s) do you think you will use, what will you use it/them for, and why did you make those choices?  
- Structured Analysis and Design  
- Data Modeling  
- Object Oriented Analysis and Design  
- Prototyping  
- Waterfall  
- RAD  
- XP  
- Scrum  
- FDD  

How will you actually implement the method(s) you choose, as a group? 

** Deliverable **  
Turn in one .doc, .docx, or pdf for your group with your group's answers.
