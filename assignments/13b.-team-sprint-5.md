## Make A Login Server, and A Basic Example App 
1. I created a directory for my own fork of the dex project, but you can clone the original or your own fork.  You might want to clone my fork, just to make sure yours works the same. So, my directory for projects I fork is `$HOME/github/sgoggins` because that's my github username. 
2. `cd $HOME/github/sgoggins`
3. `virtualenv --python=python3 ../virtualenvs/dex` : This can be wherever you keep your python virtual environments. I keep mine at the root of my $HOME/github directory, so it would be `$HOME/virtualenvs/dex` in this case. 
4. `source ../virtualenvs/dex/bin/activate` : Then you activate it. 
5. `git clone https://github.com/sgoggins/dex.git`
6. Make sure  you have `go` installed using the command `which go` If you do not have `go` the language installed, or in your path, instructions are here: `https://golang.org/doc/install`
7. `cd dex` puts you in the project directory. 
8.  `make` will build your project for you
9. `./bin/dex serve examples/config-dev.yaml` will start the **OPENID Connect Provider** 
10. `./bin/example-app` will run the sample **OPENID Connect App**.

## The Dex Project does a good job of explaining the various moving parts in a single sign on system.
