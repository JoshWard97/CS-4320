# GitMagic assignment Rubric

Note: Sean told someone that if they had a commit to the master branch they were good.

Also, when introducing the assignment, Sean did say he usually forks. Some may take that as OKing forks even though the assignment says branch and Sean did correct himself and say branch.

Also, there was a problem in Canvas, where when we extended the assignment to Friday midnight, it did not allow re-submissions or even first-time submissions. Students were told to submit via a comment on the assignment. Allow late submissions even past Friday midnight due to this issue.

We will ignore whether their compile worked or whether they caused merge conflicts or whether they fixed other people's problems - just because it is too hard to figure out who did what.
