# Exercise 2 Rubric

Out of 50 points:

50 Points: 
Addressed all the below items, but maybe not ordered or numbered in this way. Items can be combined.
1. Had something for their own ideas for the reasons for the list of problems in the software industry and how to address these problems (from in class on Tuesday, before they did the readings.)  
2. Broken down as below:  
2a. How did conference participants describe the issues of the software crisis: the group makes note of if the conference participants agree with Wikipedia and if they found anything different. This is organized and expressed in a way that is easy to understand.  
2b. The group lists ideas the conference participants had to address the issues. This is organized and expressed in a way that is easy to understand. 
2c. The group mentions which stakeholders would be most concerned with the different crisis issues and their suggestions make sense. I.E. being over-budget is mainly a management or business concern, and code being difficult to maintain is a developer concern (and could also be a business concern), not meeting requirements or low quality is primarily a user concern (as well as business), etc.  
2d. They have at least one comment on what they thought about something the conference discussed.  
3. They have at least one suggestion for an additional problem not addressed at the NATO conference. I'm expecting security, but it might be something else.

45 Points: They have items 1, 2a, 2b, and 2c and skipped 2d and/or 3, OR they have 2d and 3 but one of the others is lacking something to make it top-notch. On the whole though, this includes answers to all four core questions and is very good work, well organized and expressed.

40 Points: They have items 1, 2a, 2b, and 2c but there are some moderate issues with organization and clarity OR it is well organized but they skipped one of the four core questions. Including 2d or 3 does not make up for skipping one of the core questions, but should be mentioned as good that they addressed it. Answers in general are good.

35 Points: They either had significant issues with organization and summarizing or being clear and/or they missed addressing 2 items among the core questions 1, 2a, 2b, and 2c. It may appear that it was rushed or thrown together but there is some substance there.

30 Points: They turned something in but it was not organized in a coherent fashion (can't understand it) and/or 3 or all 4 items of the core questions were skipped OR the content is very minimal.
