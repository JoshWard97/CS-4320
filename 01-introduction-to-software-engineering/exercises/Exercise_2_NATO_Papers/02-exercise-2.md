# Exercise 2: Software Engineering: Solving Problems Facing the Computing Profession
**DUE DATE** : 

## History 
By the 1960's computers were becoming large and complex and software programs were likewise growing in size and complexity. This complexity led to a "software crisis."  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_crisis) lists some manifestations of the software crisis that troubled the industry in the late 1960's:
- Projects running over-budget
- Projects running over-time
- Software was very inefficient
- Software was of low quality
- Software often did not meet requirements
- Projects were unmanageable and code difficult to maintain
- Software was never delivered

## NATO
In 1968 and 1969, two conferences were sponsored by NATO to address the software crisis. The conferences were titled *Software Engineering* and *Software Engineering Techniques* - titles that were provocative at the time, implying an engineering approach to software development.

## Group Exercise
Due according to the assignment calendar. 

1. Brainstorm and discuss on our Canvas discussion forum **as an entire class, before Thursday's Class**, what you think may have been some of the reasons for the above problems (i.e., how or why did complexity cause these problems) and what could be some ways to address the issues.
2. In Your Groups, Divide up the two NATO conference reports to be read *or skimmed* (yes, it is a lot of material) and address the questions:
   - [NATO: 1968 Report](../readings/nato1968.PDF) (231 pgs, 9 sections of varying lengths and numbers of sub-subsections)
   - [NATO: 1969 Report](../readings/nato1969.PDF) (164 pgs, 7 sections of varying lengths and numbers of sub-sections)
  - How did the conference participants describe the issues of the "software crisis" (they may or may not identify the same issues listed in Wikipedia)?
  - What ideas did they have for addressing the issues?
  - Note which groups of "stakeholders" each issue was most a concern for (i.e., business owners, business managers, developers, software users, etc..)
  - If you have comments or thoughts on their ideas, include those also.
  - Record your responses to be turned in.
3. Are there any additional problems related to software development today that you are aware of that were not listed or discussed at the NATO conferences?
  - Record any thoughts you have on this to be turned in.

**Note**  
Plan how to work together to combine your work into one document - perhaps using a shared Google doc or GitHub markdown. What organization will you use for the document? How will you avoid duplication and make sure the document is coherent? How will you make sure the document is in the correct format to be turned in?

**DELIVERABLE**  
 One .doc, .docx, or .pdf with the combined work of your group addressing all three questions, to be turned into Canvas by one group member on behalf of your group by the deadline for this assignment.
